# Using SLEAP to identify animal body-parts

This project uses [sleap](https://sleap.ai) to
estimate on datasets body-parts of animals.

## What is SLEAP?
Sleap is a deep-learning framework built in Python.
It was built to locate animal body parts by pose estimation.
Allows for the pose estimation of multiple animals at a time.
Allows for human in the loop, where we came in and did our minimal training.

## Our work

We used SLEAP's UNet architechture and trained it
to estimate the body-parts of flies on a given
dataset. We divided that dataset of 2000 samples into 
80% training and 20% testing and validation.
