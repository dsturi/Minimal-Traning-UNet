# Post-estimation on animal Body-Parts using SLEAP

This project uses [the SLEAP](https://sleap.ai) deep-learning framework in order
to train a UNet to estimate on body-parts of animals, in this case of flies.

## What is SLEAP?

SLEAP is a deep-learning framework that is built to estimate body-parts of animals
on a given dataset.

Please visit follow [SLEAP's Tutorial](https://sleap.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html)
to better understand and try them out!

## The notebook

We provide a notebook with multiple functions that help manipulate the dataset
a lot more easier.

For example
```
def get_indx(list_of_GT, list_of_Pred)
```
Is a function that gets you the (x,y) coordinates of the heatmaps
generated by the neural network and the ground truths of the given
dataset.
